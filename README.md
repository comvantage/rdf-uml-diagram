===============

RDF UML Diagram Visualisation is a small tool for quick visualisation of RDF datasets. it provides a graphical representation of RDF data sets similar to UML class diagrams for RDFS/OWL vocabularies and UML object diagrams for instance data.
Technically it is a python3 script with command line interface which converts RDF files to PNG diagrams by using the layout engine of Graphviz.

The layout is done by Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/) which has to be installed (version>2.30)
